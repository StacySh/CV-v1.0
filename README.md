# CV-v1.0

## How does this work?
I used the amazing generator-webapp as a starting point for this site, and added a few things to make it my own.

 - Responsive sites build with Bootstrap
 - Animations created with CSS Animations

## Getting Started

- Install: `npm install --global yo gulp-cli generator-webapp`
- Run `yo webapp` to scaffold your webapp
- Run `npm start` to preview and watch for changes
- Run `npm start -- --port=8080` to preview and watch for changes in port `8080`
- Run `npm install --save <package>` to install dependencies, frontend included
- Run `npm run  serve:test` to run the tests in the browser
- Run `npm run  serve:test -- --port=8085` to run the tests in the browser in port `8085`
- Run `npm run build` to build your webapp for production
- Run `npm run serve:dist` to preview the production build
- Run `npm run serve:dist -- --port=5000` to preview the production build in port `5000`
